# UCA Computer Science Independent Study Course Github Page
Supervisor : Dr. Sinan Kockara

** Meeting date : Wednesday's 10:00 am at 311 HPC Lab **

 - ** Write a paragraph about next week plan and submit to Dr. Kockara. **
 - ** After each week presentation, we need to submit our progress report. This report will tell about our last week's progress on the proposed plan one week before. **
 - ** Our main focus is implementing ConvNets to train and test the data to predict malignancy of the image. **
