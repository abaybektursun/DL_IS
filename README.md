**Supervisor : Dr. Sinan Kockara**
<br>
**Meeting date : Wednesday's 10:00 am at 311 HPC Lab**

 - Write a paragraph about next week plan and submit to Dr. Kockara.
 - After each week presentation, we need to submit our progress report. This report will tell about our last week's progress on the proposed plan one week before.
 - Our main focus is implementing ConvNets to train and test the data to predict malignancy of the image.


 ## Timeline


 - **Week 1** (02/08/2017)
	- Fundamentals of Deep Learning math background (Plan)

	- Introduction to Deep Learning Math background, started from Neural Network algorithm idea and how the algortihm was changed in time was discussed.
	- Tasks for **Week 2**;
		- Practice Neural Network single hidden layer algorithm manually by solving simple matrix operatins step by step.
		- Implement simple Convolutional Neural Network algorithm on Caffe framework by using the dataset shared on last Wednesday. Create a report for the result to explain how the performance is and the specs of the computer that you use for the calculations. 
		- Do literature survey on Deep Learning to have knowledge about how Deep Learning performance changes in time, and what is the state-of-the-art studies related to Deep Learning.

 - **Week 2** (02/15/2017)
	- Introduction to Caffe.
	- Sample project/example of Caffe. (with and without CUDA implementation)
	- Learning about our dataset. 

 - **Week 3** (02/22/2017)
	- How to train Caffe Convolutional Neural Network system?
	- Implementation of the system will start from this week.

 - **Week 4** (03/01/2017)
	- Neural Network backpropagation algorithm presentation.
	- Research topic : How to remove noises on our image dataset?
		- There are some solutions out there but we need to select the appropriate one.
		- Image colorization with CNN-Autoencoders.
	- Print out all your Neural Network study and share with group. 

 - **Week 5** (03/08/2017)
	- Present Neural Network backrpopagation algorithm. Also look for other algorithms how do they work.
	- Read image processing with CNN papers and run their sample code with our image dataset.
